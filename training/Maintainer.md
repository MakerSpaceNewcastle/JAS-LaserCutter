Laser Maintainer
================

The laser requires regular maintenance to ensure proper operation, this involves exposing potentially dangerous and fragile parts of the machine and should not be attempted by anyone without the maintainer training.

The maintenance falls into two sets of routine checks which should be completed every two weeks and month respectively.

Information about the maintenance plan and how to carry out each procedure can be found in the ```maintenance``` directory.
