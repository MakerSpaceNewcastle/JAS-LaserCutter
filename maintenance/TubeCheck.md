CO2 Laser Tube and Coolant Check
================================

It is important that the flow of coolant through the laser tube is not restricted and that the tube is in good working order, this check is for any issues with the coolant system and a general visual inspection of the tube.

This guide assumes the machine is fully powered off and that both the honeycomb and knife beds are present.

External Coolant System Check
-----------------------------

  1.  Power on the water pump and air pump
  2.  Look around the machine and check that there are no obstructions to the water cooling tubes
  3.  Check that the flow of water through the tube is constant and of the correct volume
  4.  Check that all connections are tight and secure and that no water is leaking
  5.  Check all connections on the air pump for blockages and leaks
  6.  Check that there is a good flow of air from the conical nozzle on the lens head
  7.  Power off the water pump and air pump

Internal Coolant System Check
-----------------------------

  1.  Power on the water pump
  2.  Open the front double doors
  3.  Check that all water pipe connections are secure and no water is leaking
  4.  Power off the water pump

Tube and Coolant Check
----------------------

Note: this check is potentially dangerous as it exposes the laser tube, ensure power to the laser cutter is removed

  1.  Power on the water pump
  2.  Open the rear tube cover
  3.  Check for any obvious visual damage to the tube (e.g. cracks, leaking water inside the tube), this is very unlikely but worth checking in any case
  4.  Use caution as the tube may be hot, avoid touching the tube in any case
  5.  Ensure that all coolant connections are tight and secure and that no water is leaking
  6.  Ensure that there are no air bubbles stuck in the dimples in the coolant tube (second tube inside the large outer tube)
  7.  If there are any bubbles they can be removed by pinching the inlet tube and releasing it sharply, the suddent change in water flow should help to shift small bubbles
  8.  Any larger or more stubborn bubbles can be removed by lifting the left hand side (looking from the front) of the machine, forcing the bubbles up the tube (note that the coolant port labeling on the tube is incorrect (as of writing))
  9.  Replace all covers
  10.  Power off the water pump
