Bed Cleaning
============

Over use the machine bed (lowest level bed, on which the knife bed sits) will collect fragments dropped through the other beds and general dust and dirt, this can cause issues with bed leveling if a section gets stuck in between two beds or may fall and obstruct the Z drive belt.

This guide assumes that the machine is fully powered off and both the honeycomb and knife beds are present.

To rectify this follow the following steps to clean material from the bed:

  1.  Power on the laser cutter
  2.  Move the Z axis up high enough to remove the honeycomb bed
  3.  Remove the honeycomb bed and knife bed
  4.  Collect any large pieces of material on the bed
  5.  Raise the Z axis until the machine bed is flush with the surrounds (you will likely hit the Z endstop, don't worry about this)
  6.  Sweep any remaining dust off the bed
  7.  Lower the Z axis enough to replace the two beds
  8.  Replace the knife bed, ensuring that the top top edge of the bed touched the upper surround and the bed is fairly central in the X axis
  9.  Replace the honeycomb bed, ensuring that the top right corner of the bed is tight into the top right corner of the surround
  10.  Move the Z axis to a reasonable position (e.g. the honeycomb bed is flush with the surround)
  11.  Power off the laser cutter
