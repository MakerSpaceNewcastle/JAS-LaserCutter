Bed Leveling
============

Over time the bed may become unlevel, it is important to keep the bed level to ensure a constant focal distance over the entire bed.

This guide assumes the machine is fully powered off and that both the honeycomb and knife beds are present.

Checking Bed Level
------------------

  1.  Power on the laser cutter and open the main guard
  2.  Move the Z axis until the top right corner of the honeycomb bed is flush with the top right corner of the surround
  3.  Check that the bed is also flush at the top left and bottom right corner
  4.  If not the bed is not level, proceed to Bed Leveling, otherwise the bed is level

Bed Leveling
------------

Assuming follow on from Checking Bed Level.

  1.  Open the double doors on the front of the machine (doors can be removed for better access)
  2.  Obtain the smallest allen key from the laser cutter tools and, if desired, power off the machine for safety
  3.  Loosen both tensioners in the bottom of the case
  4.  Rotate each screw until the bed is flush in all corners
  5.  Tighten the rightmost tensioner first, leave the belt fairly slack at this point
  6.  Tighten the leftmost tensioner, ensure the belt is properly aligned on each pulley and has a fair amount of tension
  7.  Power on the machine and test the Z axis
  8.  Ensure both beds are properly aligned as described in Bed Clean
  9.  Replace both front double doors and ensure they are properly closed/locked
  10.  Power off the machine
